## APOCALYPSE CONCEPT
- Required:
    - Fix game logic. The luck score will be decided at random at the start of the game.
    - Events will need re-thinking. Not by severity? But by game progress. The further into
    the game, the more deadly the enemies. Some kind of group
    - Each choice will have two outcomes, not one. Only one outcome will be returned with the 
    resource though, determined in the backend logic. The outcome will be determined by luck score.
    - Fix routes.
# 

- Future:
    - Change luck bar for a message about luck.
    - Replace health bar with an image depicting health?
    - Once this is done we can remove bootstrap and bootstrap vue.
    - Fix tailwind css purge
    - Make admin a part of the same vue instance / link to login auth route
