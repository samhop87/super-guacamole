## Stuff to do:
- Required
    - Add a datatable to display the current events.
    - Once datatable created, redirect back to index on successful creation.
    - Fix image loading to prevent default appearing first.
     
- Future
    - Add months to game, firing the event call at random.
    - Add date to event when returned, so it appears event happens on a given day
    - Add two outcomes to each choice in table (use nested sets?)
    - Build own status bars, that way we can remove bootstrap from styles and reduce filesize
    - Fix tailwindcss purging issue.
    - Make admin a part of the same vue instance / link to login auth route
